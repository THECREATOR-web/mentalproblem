Mental Playground — interactive site

What this is
- A small, playful single-page site that lists many mental problems, symptoms, and short calming methods/exercises.
- It is illustrative and designed for exploration and short exercises, not for diagnosis or treatment.

Files
- `index.html` — main page.
- `styles.css` — visual styles.
- `script.js` — data and interactive code.

Run locally
Open `index.html` in your browser. For full behavior (some browsers block local scripts), run a tiny local server, e.g.:

```bash
# Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Notes & next steps
- Add more problem entries in `script.js` to expand the catalogue.
- Consider adding audio guidance, translations, or a backend to save notes.
- If you or someone is in immediate danger or crisis, contact local emergency services or a mental health professional. This project is not a substitute for professional care.
